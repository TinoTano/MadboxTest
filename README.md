# MadboxTest
## Test made for Madbox interview

## Answers:

### The time it took you to perform the exercise: 
	5:30h
### The parts that were difficult for you and why
	I haven't found any part difficult but I lost time in some parts and couldn't do a better game without losing more time...
### The parts you think you could do better and how
	Design of level. It's basic and should be more challenging. I should add curves, different heights and other obstacles.
### What you would do if you could go a step further on this game
	More levels with a better design, more obstacles, better graphics and multiplayer (local).
### What did you think
	First I though that test will be easy and fast looking the game to clone. But time ran out too fast and I'm not very happy with the visual part of the game (level design and graphics).
### Any comment you may have
	I know that test was 5h maximum.
	I have lost some time with a bug that I hve found and couldn't make it in 5h. I don't want to lie with the time. If the test is not valid because of that it's ok.
